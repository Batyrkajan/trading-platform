## KEY PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### What Worked (80% Win Rate)

```
WINNING FORMULA:
1. THEME + TREND alignment
2. Pullback entry (not chasing)
3. Catalyst as booster
4. $1-6 option price
5. 3-7% OTM strikes
6. 2-4 week expiration
7. Position size 2-4% of account
```

### What Didn't Work

```
LOSING PATTERNS:
1. Lottery tickets (<$1) = -$18,752
2. Unfamiliar sectors (LULU, CVX)
3. China exposure (BABA)
4. Friday entries
5. Chasing gaps
6. No thesis trades
```

---

## ACCOUNT PROGRESSION

```
Starting Point (Sep 9): ~$20,000 (estimated)

Week 1-3: -$4,913 (learning period)
Week 4: +$857 (finding edge)
Week 5: +$64,928 (AMD home run)
Week 6-14: +$2,670 (consolidation)

## FUTURES TRADING (Separate)

| Month | P&L | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| October | -$33,612 | GC gold disaster |
| November | -$536 | Reduced size |
| **Total** | **-$34,148** | Learning experience |

**Lesson: Stick to what works (options), be careful with futures**

---

## CONCLUSIONS

### Edge Identified
1. **Tech sector expertise** (AMD, NVDA, PLTR)
2. **Catalyst-driven trades** (earnings, partnerships)
3. **Trend + catalyst combo** = highest returns
4. **Put hedges work** when used on familiar tickers

### Improvements Needed
1. Avoid lottery tickets (<$1 options)
2. Stay in familiar sectors
3. Trade Monday/Wednesday primarily
4. Cut losers faster (-30% stop)
5. Take profits systematically (+50%, +100%)

### Strategy Going Forward
- Quality over quantity
- Theme-based positioning
- Let catalysts find you
- Adapt to market regime (currently: rotation out of tech)

## BEST TRADE: AMD OpenAI Partnership

```
Date: October 6, 2025
Ticker: AMD
Position: $172.50 Calls
Entry: ~$1.50
Exit: $48.46
Contracts: ~10
Profit: +$48,460
Return: 3,130%

WHAT MADE IT WORK:
1. Already positioned in AMD (AI theme)

6. Took profits at peak

THIS IS THE MODEL FOR FUTURE TRADES.
