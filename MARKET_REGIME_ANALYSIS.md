## PART 2: SECTOR ANALYSIS & CORRELATIONS

### Current Sector Rankings (December 2025)

| Rank | Sector | ETF | YTD Return | Status |
|------|--------|-----|------------|--------|
| 1 | **Technology** | XLK | +24.5% | Leading but consolidating |
| 2 | **Financials** | XLF | +18% | Rising, benefiting from rate cuts |
| 3 | **Industrials** | XLI | +15% | Steady, defensive rotation |
| 4 | **Healthcare** | XLV | +12% | Defensive, gaining strength |
| 5 | **Consumer Disc** | XLY | +10% | Mixed signals |

### Sector Correlations That Matter

```
YOUR TECH FOCUS (XLK):
├── HIGH correlation with:
│   ├── QQQ (Nasdaq 100) - 0.95 correlation
│   ├── SOXX (Semiconductors) - 0.90 correlation
│   └── SMH (Semis) - 0.88 correlation
│
├── MODERATE correlation with:
│   ├── XLY (Consumer Discretionary) - 0.70 (TSLA, AMZN)
│   └── XLC (Communications) - 0.65 (META, GOOGL)
│
└── LOW correlation with:
    ├── XLF (Financials) - 0.45 ← DIVERSIFICATION OPPORTUNITY
    ├── XLE (Energy) - 0.30
    └── XLU (Utilities) - 0.15
```

### How Financials (XLF) Correlate With Your Tech Strategy

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**

1. **Diversification**: When tech sells off, financials often hold or rally
2. **Rate sensitivity**: Financials benefit from rate cuts (net interest margin)
3. **Different catalysts**: Bank earnings, economic data vs tech earnings, AI news

**CORRELATION MATRIX:**

| | XLK | XLF | QQQ | SPY |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **XLK** | 1.00 | 0.45 | 0.95 | 0.85 |
| **XLF** | 0.45 | 1.00 | 0.40 | 0.75 |
| **QQQ** | 0.95 | 0.40 | 1.00 | 0.90 |
| **SPY** | 0.85 | 0.75 | 0.90 | 1.00 |

**PRACTICAL IMPLICATION:**
- When QQQ drops 5%, XLF might only drop 2%
- Holding some XLF calls as portfolio diversification makes sense
- But your EDGE is in tech - don't chase unfamiliar sectors

## PART 5: SECTOR ROTATION FRAMEWORK

### When to Rotate Sectors

```
RISK-ON Environment (VIX < 20, SPY rising):
├── Overweight: XLK (Tech), XLY (Consumer Disc)
├── Market weight: XLF (Financials), XLI (Industrials)
└── Underweight: XLU (Utilities), XLP (Staples)

RISK-OFF Environment (VIX > 25, SPY falling):
├── Overweight: XLV (Healthcare), XLU (Utilities)
├── Market weight: XLF (Financials)
└── Underweight: XLK (Tech), XLY (Consumer Disc)
```

### Your Simplified Approach

**STICK TO YOUR EDGE (Tech), but monitor:**

1. **QQQ** - If QQQ breaks support, reduce tech exposure
2. **VIX** - If VIX spikes >25, buy puts for protection
3. **XLF** - If rotating into financials, consider JPM/BAC options (not your expertise though)

### When Financials Matter For Tech

| XLF Signal | Meaning for Tech |
|------------|------------------|
| XLF rising + XLK rising | HEALTHY rally, risk-on |
| XLF rising + XLK falling | Rotation OUT of tech |
| XLF falling + XLK rising | Tech-only rally, watch for reversal |
| XLF falling + XLK falling | RISK-OFF, buy protection |

## PART 6: HEDGING STRATEGY

### Portfolio-Level Hedging

**When to Hedge:**
- Portfolio up >20% for the month
- VIX <14 (protection is cheap)
- Major event coming (FOMC, CPI, earnings)
- You feel "invincible" (contrarian warning)

**How to Hedge:**

| Method | When to Use | Cost |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **QQQ Puts** | General tech hedge | 2-3% of portfolio |
| **SPY Puts** | Broad market hedge | 2-3% of portfolio |
| **VIX Calls** | Volatility spike hedge | 1-2% of portfolio |
| **Individual Puts** | Single stock hedge | 30-50% of position |

### Hedge Sizing

```
Portfolio Value: $83,000
Monthly Gain: +20% = $16,600

HEDGE CALCULATION:
├── Unrealized gains: $16,600
├── Hedge budget: 15% of gains = $2,490
├── QQQ $510 puts (2 weeks out): ~$3.00 each
├── Contracts: 8 contracts = $2,400
└── Protection: Covers ~$40,000 notional
```
