# DAILY OPTIONS TRADING WORKFLOW

Based on your proven edge: Catalyst-driven, near-the-money options on tech stocks.

---

## STEP 1: MORNING SCAN (6:00-7:00 AM)

### A. Check Overnight News

**Sources to check daily:**
1. **Finviz.com** → News tab → Filter by your tickers
2. **X/Twitter** → Follow: @DeItaone, @FirstSquawk, @zaborowitz
3. **Earnings Whispers** → https://www.earningswhispers.com/calendar
4. **Fed Calendar** → https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm

### B. Your Watchlist (Tier 1 Tickers)

Focus on these - you know them well:
```
AMD   - Your best performer (+$48k single trade)
NVDA  - Consistent wins
TSLA  - High volatility plays
PLTR  - Momentum plays
GOOGL - Reliable moves
AAPL  - Steady trends
```

### C. What You're Looking For

**GREEN FLAGS (Trade today):**
- [ ] Major partnership/deal announced
- [ ] Analyst upgrade with price target raise
- [ ] Earnings in 1-2 weeks (pre-earnings run)
- [ ] Sector catalyst (Fed, China news, AI developments)
- [ ] Technical breakout on high volume

**RED FLAGS (No trade):**
- [ ] No clear catalyst
- [ ] IV is extremely high (pre-earnings crush risk)
- [ ] Stock already moved 5%+ (missed it)
- [ ] You're unsure why it's moving

---

## STEP 2: BUILD YOUR THESIS (Before Market Open)

### The 1-Sentence Rule

Before ANY trade, write ONE sentence explaining WHY:

**Template:**
> "f[TICKER] should move [UP/DOWN] because [CATALYST] by [TIMEFRAME]"

**Good Examples:**
> "AMD should move UP because the OpenAI partnership announcement will drive institutional buying this week"

> "NVDA should move UP because earnings are in 10 days and AI demand narrative is strong"

> "TSLA should move DOWN because delivery numbers missed and puts are cheap"

**Bad Examples:**
> "AMD looks good" ← No catalyst
> "Everyone on Twitter is buying NVDA" ← Not your thesis
> "It's oversold" ← Technical only, no catalyst

---

## STEP 3: SELECT YOUR STRIKE & EXPIRATION

### Strike Selection Matrix

| Your Conviction | Strike Distance | Example (Stock at $200) |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **HIGH** (Clear catalyst) | 3-5% OTM | $206-$210 call |
| **MEDIUM** (Good setup) | 5-7% OTM | $210-$214 call |
| **LOW** (Speculative) | 7-10% OTM | $214-$220 call |
| **NEVER** | >10% OTM | $220+ (lottery ticket) |

### Expiration Selection

| Catalyst Type | Expiration | Why |
|---------------|------------|-----|
| **Earnings play** | Week of earnings or week after | Capture the run-up |
| **News/Deal** | 1-2 weeks out | Time for market to react |
| **Macro event** (Fed) | 2-3 weeks out | Theta protection |
| **Swing trade** | 3-4 weeks out | Flexibility |

### Price Sweet Spot

Your data shows best results with options priced **$1.00 - $6.00**:
- Below $1.00 = Usually lottery tickets (8% win rate)
- $1.00-$6.00 = Your sweet spot (80% win rate)
- Above $10.00 = Works but ties up more capital

---

## STEP 4: POSITION SIZING

### Current Account: ~$83,000

```
NEVER RISK MORE THAN 4% PER TRADE = $3,320 max

Position Size Calculator:
├── High Conviction:  3-4% = $2,500 - $3,320
├── Medium Conviction: 2-3% = $1,660 - $2,500
├── Low Conviction:   1-2% = $830 - $1,660
└── Speculative:      <1%  = $500 max
```

### Scaling In (Don't Go All-In)

**Entry 1 (50%):** When thesis forms
**Entry 2 (30%):** On confirmation (stock moves your direction)
**Entry 3 (20%):** On breakout (if it happens)

---

## STEP 5: EXECUTE THE TRADE

### Pre-Trade Checklist

```
[ ] Thesis written (1 sentence)
[ ] Catalyst identified
[ ] Strike is 3-10% OTM
[ ] Expiration is 1-4 weeks out
[ ] Option price is $1-$6
[ ] Position size is <4% of account
[ ] I know my stop loss (-40%)
[ ] I know my profit targets (+50%, +100%, +200%)
```

### Order Types

**For Entry:**
- Use LIMIT orders, not market
- Bid at mid-price or slightly below
- Be patient - don't chase

**For Exit:**
- Set alerts at profit targets
- Use LIMIT orders to sell
- Don't panic sell on small dips

---

## STEP 6: MANAGE THE POSITION

### Profit Taking Rules

| Gain | Action | Example ($1,000 position) |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| **+50%** | Sell 25% | Sell $250 worth, keep $750 |
| **+100%** | Sell 50% | Sell $500, keep $500 (playing with house money) |
| **+200%** | Sell 75% | Sell $750, let $250 ride |
| **+300%+** | Trail stop | Set stop at 50% of gains |

### Stop Loss Rules

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Position down 40% | EXIT - no questions |
| Catalyst disproven | EXIT immediately |
| 3 days to expiration, not profitable | EXIT |
| You don't know why it's dropping | EXIT |

### When to Add (Double Down)

Only add if ALL true:
- [ ] Original thesis still valid
- [ ] Stock pulled back but catalyst intact
- [ ] You're not already at max position size
- [ ] You're not revenge trading

---

## STEP 7: HEDGING (When Up Big)

### When to Hedge

Add protection when:
- [ ] Up >20% on the week
- [ ] Single position up >100%
- [ ] Major event coming (FOMC, CPI)
- [ ] You feel "invincible" (warning sign!)

### How to Hedge

**Portfolio Hedge:**
- Buy SPY or QQQ puts
- 5-7% OTM
- 2-3 weeks out
- Size: 10-15% of unrealized gains

**Single Position Hedge:**
- Buy puts on same ticker
- ATM or slightly OTM
- Same or next week expiration
- Size: 30-50% of call position

## EXAMPLE TRADE WALKTHROUGH

### Scenario: AMD Announces AI Partnership

**Step 1: Morning Scan**
- 6:30 AM: See headline "AMD partners with Microsoft for AI chips"
- Check AMD pre-market: Up 3%

**Step 2: Build Thesis**
> "AMD should move UP because the Microsoft AI partnership validates their AI chip strategy and will drive institutional buying over the next 2 weeks"

**Step 3: Select Strike & Expiration**
- AMD currently: $140
- Strike: $145 (3.5% OTM) - HIGH conviction
- Expiration: 2 weeks out
- Option price: $3.50

**Step 4: Position Size**
- High conviction = 4% of $83k = $3,320
- $3,320 / $350 per contract = 9 contracts

**Step 5: Execute**
- 9:45 AM (after first 15 min volatility settles)
- Limit order at $3.40 (below ask)
- Filled at $3.45
- Total cost: $3,105

**Step 6: Manage**
- Set alert at $5.18 (+50%)
- Set alert at $6.90 (+100%)
- Stop loss in head at $2.07 (-40%)

**Step 7: Outcome**
- Day 3: AMD up 8%, option at $6.50 (+88%)
- Sell 5 contracts at $6.50 = $3,250 (cost recovered!)
- Let 4 contracts ride with house money
