## PART 1: TRADE SELECTION

### A. APPROVED TICKERS (Your Winners)

**Tier 1 - Primary Focus (highest win rate):**
- AMD - Your best performer ($48,460 single trade)
- NVDA - Consistent wins
- TSLA - High volatility, good for swings
- PLTR - Momentum plays

**Tier 2 - Secondary:**
- GOOGL, AMZN, AAPL, INTC, ORCL, META

**Tier 3 - Situational:**
- TSM, BABA, MU, QCOM (China/semi catalysts)
- UNH (healthcare catalysts)

**DO NOT TRADE:**
- Meme stocks without catalysts
- Low-volume options
- Anything you don't understand

### B. CATALYST TYPES (Ranked by Win Rate)

1. **Major Partnership/Deal Announcements** (90%+ win rate)
   - Example: AMD-OpenAI deal (Oct 6) = +3,130%
   - How to find: Tech news, X/Twitter, earnings calls

2. **Macro Events** (75% win rate)
   - Fed rate decisions
   - China PBOC stimulus
   - Major economic data (CPI, jobs)

3. **Earnings Plays** (70% win rate with hedges)
   - Buy 2 weeks before, sell before or hedge through
   - Never hold naked through earnings

4. **Technical Breakouts** (65% win rate)
   - Only on high-volume confirmations
   - Must have catalyst support

### C. ENTRY FILTERS (All must be TRUE)

```
[ ] Tier 1 or Tier 2 ticker
[ ] Clear catalyst within 1-2 weeks
[ ] Strike is 3-10% OTM (not more)
[ ] Option price is $1.00-$10.00 (your sweet spot)
[ ] Expiration is 1-4 weeks out
[ ] IV is not at extreme highs (pre-earnings spike)
[ ] You have conviction (can explain thesis in 1 sentence)
```

## PART 2: STRIKE & EXPIRATION SELECTION

### A. STRIKE PRICE RULES

| Scenario | Strike Selection | Example |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **High Conviction Catalyst** | 3-5% OTM | AMD at $168 → $172.50 call |
| **Moderate Conviction** | 5-7% OTM | NVDA at $185 → $195 call |
| **Speculative** | 7-10% OTM | Only 10% of portfolio |
| **NEVER** | >15% OTM | These are lottery tickets |

### B. EXPIRATION RULES

| Trade Type | Expiration | Why |
|------------|------------|-----|
| **Catalyst Trade** | 1-2 weeks | Enough time for move, max gamma |
| **Swing Trade** | 2-4 weeks | Theta decay manageable |
| **Earnings Play** | Straddle expiration week | Sell before or hedge |
| **AVOID** | Same-day/next-day | Theta kills you |

### C. OPTION PRICE SWEET SPOT

Your data shows best results with options priced $1.00-$6.00:
- Cheap enough for good leverage
- Expensive enough to have real delta
- Not lottery tickets (those lose 92% of time)

**Rule: If option is <$0.50, you're gambling. Skip it.**

## PART 3: POSITION SIZING

### A. ACCOUNT ALLOCATION

```
Total Account: $83,628

CASH RESERVE (always): 30% = $25,000
  - Never trade with this
  - Emergency buffer

ACTIVE TRADING: 70% = $58,500
  └── Quality Trades: 80% = $46,800
  └── Speculative: 10% = $5,850
  └── Hedges: 10% = $5,850
```

### B. POSITION SIZE RULES

| Account Size | Max Single Position | Max Positions |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| <$50k | 5% ($2,500) | 5-7 |
| $50k-$100k | 4% ($3,340) | 6-8 |
| >$100k | 3% | 8-10 |

**Your current max single position: $3,340 (4% of $83,628)**

### C. SCALING IN

- Never go all-in at once
- Entry 1: 50% of position
- Entry 2: 30% on confirmation
- Entry 3: 20% on breakout

---

## PART 4: EXIT RULES

### A. PROFIT TARGETS

| Gain | Action |
|------|--------|
| **+50%** | Sell 25% of position |
| **+100%** | Sell 50% of position (now playing with house money) |
| **+200%** | Sell 75% of position |
| **+300%+** | Trail stop at 50% of gains |

**AMD Example Applied:**
- Bought at $1.50, position = $900 (6 contracts)
- At $3.00 (+100%): Sell 3 contracts = $900 (got cost back)
- At $6.00 (+300%): Sell 2 contracts = $1,200
- Let 1 ride → sold at $48.46 = $4,846
- Total: $6,946 instead of panic selling at $3

### B. STOP LOSSES

| Scenario | Stop Loss |
|----------|-----------|
| **Quality Trade** | -40% from entry |
| **Speculative Trade** | -60% (accept lottery risk) |
| **Catalyst Failed** | Exit immediately, no waiting |

**Rule: If catalyst is disproven, EXIT. Don't hope.**

### C. TIME-BASED EXITS

- If <3 days to expiration and not profitable: EXIT
- If catalyst passed and no move: EXIT within 24 hours
- Never hold worthless options to $0 (sell for $0.05)

---

## PART 5: HEDGING (Your Secret Weapon)

Your put hedges had **87% win rate** and protected gains.

### A. WHEN TO HEDGE

```
[ ] Up >20% on portfolio for the week
[ ] Have large unrealized gains in single position
[ ] Major event risk coming (FOMC, CPI, earnings)
[ ] VIX below 15 (cheap protection)
```

### B. HEDGE STRUCTURE

**Portfolio Protection:**
- Buy SPY or QQQ puts
- 5-7% OTM
- 2-3 weeks out
- Size: 10-15% of unrealized gains

**Single Position Hedge:**
- Same ticker puts
- ATM or slight OTM
- Same or next week expiration
- Size: 30-50% of call position value

### C. HEDGE EXAMPLES FROM YOUR DATA

```
Week 5 (Oct 5): Account at $78k
- Bought AMD $172.50 calls at $1.50
- AMD announced OpenAI deal → calls worth $48
- HAD YOU HEDGED at +500%:
  - Bought AMD $200 puts for ~$4
  - When GC futures crashed your account, AMD puts would offset
```

3. **Never size up after wins** - Stick to 4% max
4. **Never hold through earnings** without hedge
5. **Never trade new asset classes** (learned from futures)
6. **Never ignore stop losses** - They exist for a reason

8. **Never trade more than 3 tickers** per day
9. **Never use money you need** - 30% cash always
10. **Never trade when emotional** - Walk away

### RED FLAGS (Don't Trade When)

- You're up big and feel invincible
